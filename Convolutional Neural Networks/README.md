## Convolutional Neural Networks
### [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks) - [Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/VM5KBPSBVAWJ)
In the course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

By the end, you will be able to:
* Build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks
* Apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks
* Use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.
